Game Description
When the game is run, you will see an explanation text about how to play the game. These are: move <direction>, look at the bag, save <file>, load <file>, map and exit. First, let's start with move <direction>. We can proceed by writing up, down, right and left where it says direction and when the game starts, it writes which directions we can go with the explanations of the rooms. For example, when the game is first started, it says "Connections: Up: There is lava in this room, be careful when walking! Right: This room is full of chests, there may be information inside the chests. Be careful, monsters may appear!" If we go back to the commands, secondly "look at the bag" is the text we need to write to open our inventory. We can use the items we have by looking here. Items are gained by fighting monsters. Another command is save <file>, load <file>. "save" allows us to save our progress in the game. "load" allows us to load the game. Another command is "map". By typing "map" we can see the locations and names of the rooms in the game, and finally "exit" allows us to exit the game. Apart from these, the game ends when we are killed by monsters. We can protect our game progress by saving before being killed.
